    <div class="box"><label>Our Scheduled tours in 2025</label></div>
    <p class="texti"> This coming summer we will offer a large variety of multi-day riding tours all around Iceland.
      While the tours vary in terms of length and level of difficulty, they will all allow you to discover
      the Icelandic horse in Iceland’s vast and spectacular nature and hold promise for an
      unforgettable experience.
      In most cases we will be travelling with a herd of free running horses. This allows for us to
      change horses several times during day, for our pleasure and the health of the horses, and
      we take great pride in our commitment of Smaller Groups, Bigger Herds.
      <br><br>Below, you will find an overview of all our tours, their level of difficulty and scheduled dates.
      While some departures are already sold out, we still have a few seats available on others.
      By ticking the ‘Tours with Available Seats’, you will find the tours that are still open for
      booking. Please note that the number of seats is very limited, so we urge you to secure your
      seat as soon as possible.<br><br>
      Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have questions or need further information. </p>
